## React - Fake Tweet Generator

### A tiny app where you can prank your friends.

### You can change every detail available in a tweet. You can also retrieve the most recent tweet by searching for an existing username. Twitter has created an API to get the information from Twitter. I used it to pull the information.

###  There is also an option to change the language at the top right. It also automatically captures the date and time, but does not change according to the language. At the same time, the API does not show where them shared the tweet. So i set this as standard iPhone. You can change this. 

### If you select the file from your computer for the avatar, it will automatically arrange them in appropriate sizes. But I do not guarantee correct trimming :smile:!
